# Methods


## Field Experiments.

One of the study sites was located in a perennial grassland in the province of Córdoba, Argentina (31$^\circ$ 04 S, 64$^\circ$ 31 W) in a matrix of open woodland vegetation. 
The vegetation is dominated by perennial tussock grasses, including *Festuca hieronymi* and *Stipa trichotoma*. 
Senescent, standing-dead plant litter was collected from the field site in spring (October in Argentina). 
Material was carefully selected as only recently senesced material (yellow) from the previous year's growth. 
Samples were placed in a drying oven at 65 $^\circ$C for 7 days to minimize microbial growth without altering the structure or chemical composition of the litter. 
Senescent material (0.750 g) was placed in an uncovered plastic polystyrene box measuring 8 cm wide × 13 cm long × 2.5 cm high (Fig. S1). 
The plastic box with the litter was then placed within an oblong chicken wire cage (30 cm long × 15 cm wide × 10 cm high) in which the bottom consisted of a 2-mm fiberglass mesh fabric, the ends were blocked with a porous polyurethane sponge, and the top was covered with a plastic filter. 
The cage was suspended 30 cm above the soil surface on metal stakes to prevent soil contact and provide adequate possibility for free air movement. 
Plastic filters that attenuated specific wavelengths of natural solar radiation were placed on top of the chicken wire cage and used to establish the following treatments (see Fig. S2 for transmission spectra of plastic filters): (i) control (transparent filter, 95 % transmittance of all solar radiation); (ii) attenuation of UV-B (280–315 nm, Mylar filter); (iii) attenuation of all UV radiation (280–400 nm, Costech UV filter); and (iv) attenuation of UV and blue wavelengths (280–450 nm, Costech UV filter and Rosco Lime no. 96). 
Litter was protected from all rainfall events and was not in contact with the soil surface during the period of the incubation. 
Litter was incubated for 120 days in the field, and there were eight replicates of each attenuation treatment. 
Litter from each box was collected, extraneous debris was removed, and litter was oven-dried at 65 $^\circ$C for 48 h and weighed to determine mass loss. 
Initial litter quality measurements for carbon chemistry, made by using a standard acid detergent method (45), were the following: cellulose and sugars, 49.1 ± 0.4%; hemicellulose, 37.3 ± 0.2%; and lignin,7.3 ± 0.2%.

Two photodegradation experiments and one biotic incubation experiment were conducted using cellulose-lignin (CL) substrates at the second study site, the experimental station at the College of Agronomy in Buenos Aires (34$^\circ$ 35 S, 58$^\circ$ 29 W). 
Cellulose filter papers (Whatman no.42) were cut in quarters ($\approx$ 250 mg and 31 cm$^2$ for each filter) for impregnation with a lignin solution. The solution consisted of purified sugarcane lignin powder (Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in dioxane at a concentration of 3% lignin. 
The solution was applied in 400 $\mu$L doses to achieve substrates with different concentrations of lignin ($\approx$ 5, 10, 15, 20 %). 
In addition, dioxane was added in the same dose to the 0% lignin (pure cellulose) substrates. CL substrates were left overnight to ensure complete evaporation of dioxane from the filter paper. These model substrates were similar to a thin senescent plant leaf, although some of the lignin–cellulose relationships may be lacking from these substrates when compared to actual plant litter. 
For the biotic incubation, before the lignin impregnation, a solution of ammonium nitrate was applied to the cellulose filter paper to achieve a concentration of 1.5% dry weight of nitrogen. 
CL substrates of 0, 5, 10, and 15% lignin were exposed to full solar radiation for evaluation of direct photodegradation effects (lignin dosage experiment, n = 5 for each lignin treatment). 
In addition, CL substrates of 10% lignin were subjected to light attenuation treatments (spectral attenuation experiment, n = 5 for each spectral attenuation treatment). 
The CL substrates for the lignin dosage and spectral attenuation experiments were suspended at 7 cm above the ground surface with small wire alligator clips and placed under a clear plastic film (Stretch, >90% UV-visible transmittance) to avoid wetting during rain events (n = 5 replicates for each lignin concentration). 
In the case of the spectral attenuation experiment, a cutoff plastic filter was placed above and below the CL substrate to attenuate the desired wavelengths (Fig. S2). 
In addition to the treatments mentioned for the grassland incubation experiment described above, a fifth treatment that attenuated UV and visible radiation up to 550 nm (Rosco no. 21 Orange) was added, with 5 attenuation treatments in total (n = 5 for each light treatment). 
The biotic decomposition experiment consisted of 5 levels of lignin concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 %), with two pieces of cellulose substrates (total initial mass ~500 mg) of identical lignin concentration placed in a 2-mm fiberglass mesh litterbag of 12 × 12 cm and placed on the soil surface (n = 5 for all treatments). 
All litterbags were then covered with two layers of a 3- $\times$ 3-m 75 % shade cloth. 
The substrates were incubated for 75 days for the spectral attenuation of 10% CL substrates from December to March, for 30 days for the varying CL substrates in January and for 120 days for biotic decomposition from January to April.

## Spectral Analysis of Lignin.

The absorption spectra of pure cellulose (Whatman no.42) and CL substrates were obtained using a microspectrometer (model USB4000-UV-VIS), with optics and grating optimized for measurements in the UV range and a pulsed Xe-arc lamp (model PX-2), both from Ocean Optics. 
To evaluate changes in lignin concentration during the incubation, CL substrates used in the lignin dosage and biotic decomposition experiments were analyzed for visible and infrared (VIS-IR) reflectance with a FieldSpec Pro spectrophotometer (Analytical Spectral Devices). 
The reflectance measurements were then converted to absorbance (log 1/R). Unexposed CL substrates in the range of 0–20% lignin, identical to those used in the experiments, were scanned to generate calibration regressions using the integral of absorbance in a 550- to 650-nm waveband. 
This calibration yielded a highly predictive polynomial regression equation: %lignin = 0.00003(abs)$^2$ − 0.0002(abs) − 0.0036; r$^2$ = 0.98, P < 0.0001, which was used to calculate the final lignin concentrations in the experimental substrates.
